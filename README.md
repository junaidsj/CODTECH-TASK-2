# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a deep learning model built with TensorFlow for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of results such as accuracy curves, confusion matrix, and predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10 classes like cat, dog, airplane, etc.)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: TensorFlow (Keras API)
- Visualizations: Accuracy/Loss curves, Confusion Matrix, Sample Predictions
